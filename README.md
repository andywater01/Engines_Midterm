Engines_Midterm

Option Chosen: Developer 1.

I implemented the first option from the midterm and I did this by making a dll that had a function for generating a random number between 2 specified values. I then used this dll in unity and made it so that you call the function in start which changes the position randomly within the specified range for each x, y, and z values to give users full control over where they want the object to spawn. This is important for the player expeience because if you want a wall randomly placed you can set the y value to 0 and only have x and z random so that you dont have a floating wall. 


Inctructions:
Within the build.zip folder, there is an exe which will run the dll that I created. If you want to switch with the restore one, you will need to replace the dll with the one in 
dllfiles > Restore with the one that is in Engines_Midterm_Data > Plugins > x86_x64 and run the exe again.
